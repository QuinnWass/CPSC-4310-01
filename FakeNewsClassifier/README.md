## Data Preprocessing
To preprocess the data we took an NLP specific approach. We removed stop words since they do not carry relevence, and constrained our data to only alphabetical data. Additionally, we lemmatized the data. 

After that we calculated the sentiment using NLTK for each text and title element and stored it on the row. Following this, we counted the parts of speech for each row using NTLK.

## Exploratory data analysis


## Preliminary data analysis report 
We found that while both fake and real news have faily balanced sentiments, the fake news had a slighly negative mean and the real news had a slightly positive mean.

Additionally, while the general clustering of word counts was similar in fake news and real news, fake news had a significant number of outliers. 

Graphs for this data can be found in our notebook.
